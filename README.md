The application follows a strict unidirectional data flow, decoupling the state management from the UI rendering. The core logic is encapsulated within a custom controller hook, useStickyNotes, which serves as the "single source of truth." This hook manages the complex state for note coordinates, dimensions, Z-index layering, and interaction modes (dragging vs. resizing), while the view layer consists of pure, stateless presentational components (StickyNote, TrashCan). This separation of concerns ensures the code is testable, maintainable, and easily scalable.

To achieve high-performance interactions indistinguishable from native desktop applications, the drag-and-resize engine attaches event listeners to the global window object dynamically. This approach prevents "cursor slip" during rapid movements and decouples the interaction logic from specific DOM elements. Furthermore, data persistence is handled via an asynchronous mock API layer that simulates real-world network latency. A debouncing strategy is implemented for save operations to optimize performance, ensuring that frequent updates (like typing or dragging) do not flood the storage layer while maintaining data integrity across sessions.
